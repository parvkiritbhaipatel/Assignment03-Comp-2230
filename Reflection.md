1.Can I explain what my code does?
Summary: My code makes a game where users can choose what happens next. It uses HTML for the layout, JavaScript for the game's logic, and CSS for making it look good.

2.What was my coding process?
Summary: I planned the game, set up the layout, wrote the game's logic, and made it look good. I also tested it to make sure it works well.

3.What challenges did I have?
Summary: I had trouble keeping track of the game's state, making it look good, and fixing bugs. I solved these problems by organizing my code, trying different designs, and using tools to find and fix errors.

4.What would I do differently now?
Summary: If I did it again, I would organize my code better, make the game more fun with animations and sounds, and test it more thoroughly from the start.
